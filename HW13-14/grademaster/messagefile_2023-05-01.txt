Based on your assignment marks, I arrived at the following grade projections:
Grade projection after HW1:   93.0 (A-)
Grade projection after HW2:   99.0 (A)
Grade projection after HW3:   95.0 (A-)
Grade projection after HW4:   99.0 (A)
Grade projection after HW5:   83.7 (B)
Grade projection after HW6:   85.7 (B+)
Grade projection after HW7:   86.9 (B+)
Grade projection after HW8:   88.1 (B+)
Grade projection after HW9:    0.0 (F)
Grade projection after HW10:    0.0 (F)
Grade projection after M1:    95.8 (A)
Grade projection after M2:    40.6 (F)
Grade projection after Final:    0.0 (F)

Note: These grade projections are based on default 5-point lettergrade brackets as well as the weights for exams and homeworks indicated in the course syllabus. Your prior homework and exam averages are used as placeholders for the missing homeworks and exams, respectively. 
They do NOT yet incorporate extra credit for in-class participation, nor do they consider potential adjustments to the grade brackets. 
I'm providing the grades after each assignment to give you an idea about your progress. It is worth noting that grades tend to pick up after the first midterm.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best wishes,
